# Mermaid Live Editor

Edit, preview and share mermaid charts/diagrams.

## Features

- Edit and preview flowcharts, sequence diagrams, gantt diagrams in real time.
- Visually edit flowcharts — move boxes between groups, reorder them in the flow, and restyle them, no code required (see [Visual editing](#visual-editing)).
- Save the result as a svg
- Get a link to a viewer of the diagram so that you can share it with others.
- Get a link to edit the diagram so that someone else can tweak it and send a new link back

## Live demo

You can try out a [live version](https://mermaid.live/).

## Visual editing

Flowcharts can be edited directly on the rendered diagram — no Mermaid syntax required. In the editor, switch the preview pane from **Preview** to **Visual** using the toggle in its top-left corner. Then you can:

- **Select a node** by clicking it to edit its label, shape, colors (fill / border / text) and border width in the side panel.
- **Reorder a node in the flow** by dragging it onto a connector: the box is spliced in and the arrows reconnect automatically (`A --> B` becomes `A --> dragged --> B`), and the gap it leaves behind is healed (its old neighbours are joined).
- **Move a node between subgraphs** by dragging it onto a group, or using the _Subgraph_ dropdown in the side panel.
- **Add** nodes and groups, change the diagram **direction**, and **delete** nodes from the top toolbar.

Every visual change rewrites the Mermaid code in the editor (and edits to the code update the diagram), so you can switch between typing and visual editing freely. Frontmatter, `click` handlers, `linkStyle` and comments are preserved. Visual editing currently supports `flowchart` / `graph` diagrams; other diagram types fall back to read-only preview.

## Docker

### Run published image

```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --publish 8000:8080 ghcr.io/mermaid-js/mermaid-live-editor
```

The published docker image is built using our default environment variables. You cannot override them when running the image. If you need to customize them, you will need to build the image yourself.

### To configure renderer URL

When building set the MERMAID_RENDERER_URL build argument to the rendering
service.
Example:
Default is`https://mermaid.ink`.
Set to empty string to disable PNG and SVG links under Actions

### To configure Kroki Instance URL

When building set the MERMAID_KROKI_RENDERER_URL build argument to your Kroki
instance.
Default is `https://kroki.io`
Set to empty string to disable Kroki link under Actions

### To configure Analytics

When building set the MERMAID_ANALYTICS_URL build argument to your plausible instance, and MERMAID_DOMAIN to your domain.

Default is empty, disabling analytics.

### To enable Mermaid Chart links and promotion

When building set the MERMAID_IS_ENABLED_MERMAID_CHART_LINKS build argument to `true`

Default is empty, disabling button to save to Mermaid Chart and promotional banner.

### To update the Security modal

The modal shown on clicking the security link assumes analytics, renderer, Kroki
and Mermaid chart are enabled. You can update it by modifying `Privacy.svelte`
if you wish.
